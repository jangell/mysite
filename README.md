# jangell.org
This is a number of web apps, all rolled into one to deploy together on my personal site, jangell.org. The projects still in use are:
## home
Personal homepage with a portfolio, skills, and interests
## plotbot
Plotting software for Raman spectroscopy built on top of Plotly.js
## checkin
A small app to update where I am, what I'm up to, etc (I made this on a trip one time so that my mom wouldn't worry so much about where I was)
## gg
A database and exploratory map to facilitate guerrilla gardening, primarily in London. This is under active development and will be expanded to include filters, more information, guides, etc.
